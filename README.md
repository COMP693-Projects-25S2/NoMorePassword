**A Distributed Identity Verification Platform to Replace Traditional Password Systems**

## Project Summary

**No More Password** is an independent learning project aimed at eliminating the hassle of using passwords for online services. By leveraging blockchain-inspired architecture and client-side behavioral data logging, this project proposes a new method of verifying user identity without account-password pairs.

This platform will also include a mock commercial website to demonstrate how identity verification can work without traditional login systems.

## Motivation

In today's digital world, managing multiple passwords across different platforms has become a daily burden for users and a significant cost for developers. Most password systems are not for financial protection but merely for verifying identity. This project challenges that paradigm.

## Goals

- Develop a desktop application that manages identity verification via decentralized user behavior data.
- Simulate commercial websites that can verify users without requiring passwords.
- Eliminate the need for users to remember, reset, or manage passwords.

##  Tools & Technologies

- **Frontend/Desktop**: Electron, HTML/CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend**: Node.js, Flask
- **Database**: MySQL
- **Scripting/Logic**: Python
- **Others**: GitHub for version control, multiple client PCs for testing

## Key Features

### NMP Project Framework
- Electron-based app structure
- Integrated browser with backend communication

### Basic Functionalities
- Behavioral identity verification
- User activity logging

### Client-Side Decentralized Interaction
- Peer-to-peer behavior data exchange
- Local data storage and request validation

### Commercial Website Simulation
- Seamless login through behavior analysis (via NMP)
- Fallback traditional login for users outside NMP

## Testing & Validation

All functionalities will be tested on a mock commercial website where user interaction is monitored and verified using blockchain-like client coordination.
